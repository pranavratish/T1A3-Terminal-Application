# Status Update #1

There were no significant changes to the features nor to the implementation plan.

## Issues/Challenges

During this first half of the creation of the app i have encountered many issues. A lot of these issues were resolved by simply recognizing some sort of syntactic error in the commands i was giving. However some issues, like the difficulty in understanding scope and understanding how certain functions work, required more research and critical thinking. I also faced challenges when implementing json into my code, seeing as i had never worked with it before.
